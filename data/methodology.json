        "content": "We propose a novel neural architecture that integrates multi-scale attention mechanisms with hierarchical feature extraction. The architecture consists of three main components: (1) a feature extraction backbone based on ResNet-50, (2) a multi-head attention module that captures spatial relationships, and (3) a hierarchical fusion layer that combines features at different scales.",
