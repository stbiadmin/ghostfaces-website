  "abstract": "We present a novel neural architecture that significantly improves performance on computer vision tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach combines attention mechanisms with hierarchical feature extraction to achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed method demonstrates superior accuracy compared to existing approaches while requiring 40% fewer computational resources during inference.",
